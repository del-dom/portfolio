						Welcome to my quick portfolio website. This page gives a brief overview of the projects I have been working on. 
						While I have tried to give examples of my work here not all of my work is publicly accessible. Some other minor personal projects 
						are also available for perusal on my github.
					</p>

						<h2>Michigan State University (MSU) College of Agriculture and Natural Resources (CANR)- Enterprise Systems Programing (ESP) application shell</h2>
						<p>
							As you scroll through my professional portfolio you will notice a very similar design across all of the applications
							I have worked on at MSU CANR ESP. This similarity is due to a project I led in 2019 to build a application shell, framework
							and design language to be used across our portfolio to maintain a level of brand cohesion not only with the university style guides
							but also with the college and unit styles in addition to our own teams styling needs.
						</p>
						<p>
							This framework application manages the standard application needs like authentication and user management. It also works as the starting
							point for our applications so it instills that design language across not only our code base but also our brand identity. We do have 
							flexibility with our clients to deviate from the standard design but most choose to stay relatively close to our standard UI.
						</p>

					<div class="itemContainer cell small-12">
						<h2><a href="https://events.anr.msu.edu/">CANR Events Management System (CANR EMS)</a></h2>
						<p>
							This is the largest system to date that I have worked on. It has been in operation since 2013. Its annual revenue is around 3 million dollars
							and it annually facilitates nearly 80,000 Michigan residents attending programs and trainings offered by the Michigan State University Extension office.
							A core component of this system is the dynamic forms engine. The forms engine allows a wide variety of data to be collected across over 250 
							different fields and types. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I began working on CANR EMS in 2016. During my time working on it I have led the effort to implement version control for the system and the team. 
							I also led and heavily contributed to the effort to redesign the user interface. In addition to redesigning the core structure of the interfaces
							I also consulted with our primary clients to design a series of themes for them so that the theme of their registration more accurately aligns 
							with the theme of their event.
						</p>
						<p>
							Beyond UX, UI and user facing operations I have also built and improved many report generators that support the business side of the operation
							and their abilities to make informed and strategic decisions.
